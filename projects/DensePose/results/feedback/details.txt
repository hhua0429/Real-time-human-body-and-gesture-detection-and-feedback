Evaluate Pose Deviation**:
   - **Body Alignment:**  Look for any significant curvature in the spine in the actual pose compared to the standard plank pose. The standard pose should have a straight line from head to heels.
   - **Weight Distribution:** Examine if the weight distribution in the actual pose favors one side of the body more than the other. This can be seen by comparing the shoulder and hip heights.
   - **Balance:** Assess if the actual pose seems stable or if there is a risk of the body tilting or collapsing. This can be determined by looking at the alignment of the hips relative to the shoulders.

4. **Identify Strengths in Actual Pose:**
   - If the head, shoulders, and hips are aligned in a straight line, highlight this as a strength.
   - If the weight distribution appears balanced, mention this as a positive.

5. **Identify Weaknesses in Actual Pose:**
   - If the head is tilted or rotated, note this as a weakness.
   - If one shoulder is higher than the other, or the hips are sagging or lifted, these are weaknesses.
   - If the knees are bent or the ankles are sagging, these are weaknesses.
   - If the spine is curved, this is a significant weakness.

6. **Provide Corrective Recommendations:**
   - **Head:** If the head is tilted, recommend aligning it with the spine by drawing the chin slightly towards the chest.
   - **Shoulders:** If shoulders are misaligned, suggest focusing on pushing through both palms evenly to maintain a straight line.
   - **Hips:** If hips are sagging, recommend engaging the glutes and abdominal muscles to lift them up towards the ceiling.
   - **Legs:** If knees are bent, suggest straightening them out, and if ankles are sagging, recommend flexing the feet.
   - **Spine:** If the spine is curved, suggest engaging the core muscles to create a straight line from head to heels.
